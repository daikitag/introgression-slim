# Simulation Parameters

Please modify the parameters in `config.yaml` according to your needs. The mathematical model of the simulation is described in [Sachdeva and Barton (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.301018).

Table 1 in [Sachdeva and Barton (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.301018) summarizes the relevant parameters for simulation, and the following parameters are used in this repository to simulate introgression:

- `L`: Chromosome length of individuals (in bases)
- `z`: Initial trait value ($z_0$ in Table 1)
- `v`: Genic variance per unit map length ($V_0$ in Table 1)
- `N`: Number of individuals per generation in Wright-Fisher simulation
- `y`: Recombination rate per site (See Note below)
- `beta`: Selection gradient
- `numGen`: Number of generations in the simulation
- `num_rep`: Number of replicates. Output plots will only be generated if there is a mutation that survives until the final generation.
- `random_seed` Random seed that will be used in the simulation. The actual seed that will be used in the simulation will be different from the input random seed, as the actual random seed will be generated by using the input random seed in `config.yaml`. Please write `None` as `random_seed` if you want the simulation to be random.

## Note:

Unlike [Sachdeva and Barton (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.118.301018), recombination rate is set as rate/site, and it would be possible for the simulation to have multiple recombination breakpoints.
